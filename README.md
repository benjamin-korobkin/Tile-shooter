# Zombie Escape
Tile-based game where you shoot zombies. Built with pygame.

After learning pygame through tutorials by KidsCanCode, I decided to flesh out his last pygame tutorial, tile-based game, into more of an actual game. 
I've added ammo, more weapons, another enemy type, level transitioning a menu screen, and other additions.

A playable version can be downloaded on korben12.itch.io/zombie-escape

If there is sufficient demand, I will complete the rest of the levels I have planned for the game. However,
for now I'd like to focus on learning Godot, since it's easier to publish games from that engine.
I may even decide to complete this game using Godot! However, I have other ideas that have higher priority.

I hope you enjoy, and let me know what you think on the itch.io website!
